We gathered data on risk and preventive factors and breast cancer incidence rates from numerous online 
sources encompassing 151 countries. To evaluate the relationship between these factors and breast cancer 
incidence, we assessed the normality of the data and conducted Spearmanâ€™s correlation test. Furthermore, 
we refined six regression models to forecast future breast cancer incidence rates.
